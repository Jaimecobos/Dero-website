Utilities for 2D object detection related to answering the following questions:
1. Given an image size and bounding boxes, which bounding boxes meet certain
   requirements with respect to the image size?
2. Given an image size and bounding boxes, is an image of that size valid with
   respect to the bounding boxes according to certain requirements?

        '''
        Arguments:
            check_overlap (bool, optional): Whether or not to enforce the overlap requirements defined by
                `overlap_criterion` and `overlap_bounds`. Sometimes you might want to use the box filter only
                to enforce a certain minimum area for all boxes (see next argument), in such cases you can
                turn the overlap requirements off.
            check_min_area (bool, optional): Whether or not to enforce the minimum area requirement defined
                by `min_area`. If `True`, any boxes that have an area (in pixels) that is smaller than `min_area`
                will be removed from the labels of an image. Bounding boxes below a certain area aren't useful
                training examples. An object that takes up only, say, 5 pixels in an image is probably not
                recognizable anymore, neither for a human, nor for an object detection model. It makes sense
                to remove such boxes.
            check_degenerate (bool, optional): Whether or not to check for and remove degenerate bounding boxes.
                Degenerate bounding boxes are boxes that have `w< = 0 ` and/or `h <= 0`. In particular,
                boxes with a width and/or height of zero are degenerate. It is obviously important to filter out
                such boxes, so you should only set this option to `False` if you are certain that degenerate
                boxes are not possible in your data and processing chain.
            overlap_criterion (str, optional): Can be either of 'center_point', 'iou', or 'area'. Determines
                which boxes are considered valid with respect to a given image. If set to 'center_point',
                a given bounding box is considered valid if its center point lies within the image.
                If set to 'area', a given bounding box is considered valid if the quotient of its intersection
                area with the image and its own area is within the given `overlap_bounds`. If set to 'iou', a given
                bounding box is considered valid if its IoU with the image is within the given `overlap_bounds`.
                Only the criteria 'center-point' is implemented.
            overlap_bounds (list, optional): Only relevant if `overlap_criterion` is 'area' or 'iou'.
                Determines the lower and upper bounds for `overlap_criterion`. Is a 2-tuple of scalars
                representing a lower bound and an upper bound.
            min_area (int, optional): Only relevant if `check_min_area` is `True`. Defines the minimum area in
                pixels that a bounding box must have in order to be valid. Boxes with an area smaller than this
                will be removed.
